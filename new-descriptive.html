# Introduction
_I was given leeway to present on any metadata topic, so here goes!_

* Metadata analyst for [UC San Diego Digital Collections](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/). Special collections, research data, etc.

* Hydra-based repository; RDF-based metadata that supports transformation of MARC, MODS, SharedShelf, and more. We call these "input streams".

* Past metadata work in digital humanities, social science; video game quality assurance tester.

# Metadata Assessment & Today's Environment

# Metadata Assessment & Today's Environment
* DLF Metadata Assessment group - http://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/
    * _A wide range of groups are addressing issues related to metadata and issues related to assessment of library services, but relatively few are directly working on the assessment of metadata._

* Europeana's _Report and Recommendations from the Task Force on Metadata Quality_ - [link](http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Metadata%20Quality%20Report.pdf)
    * "Good quality metadata" defined as:
      1. Resulting from a series of trusted processes
      2. Findable
      3. Readable
      4. Standardized
      5. Meaningful to audiences
      6. Clear on re-use
      7. Visible

# What is Needed for High Quality Metadata?

* .darkblue[Trust] and .darkblue[transparency] in processes that produce metadata.

* .darkblue[Skills] development in software, data analysis, metadata enrichment, etc.

* Openly available .darkblue[documentation] of all of the above.

* .darkblue[Collaboration] between metadata staff, and management giving them "permission to learn".

# Near Future of the Library Metadata World

### Warning: speculation!

* Currently MARC vs. non-MARC: Future BIBFRAME vs. non-BIBFRAME?
    * This being "good" or "bad" depends on perspective and goals.

* Aggregators and LoC will drive rapid standards and processes development.
    * Somewhat paradoxically, MARC will survive for quite a while. (sorry, [Roy](http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2002/10/ljarchives/marc-must-die/))

* Day-to-day cataloging will look very similar to today.
    * In-depth knowledge of linked data, ontologies, and hypermedia will remain the domain of limited number of experts.

# Wrap Up

* Disruption occurring, but metadata folks can adjust with gradual skill development.

* Linked data adoption remains slow and ultimately will not change cataloging work radically.

* A focus on metadata _quality_, assessment, and documentation should be primary focus.
