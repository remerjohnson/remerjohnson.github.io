This is the site of Ryan E. Johnson. It is both a blog and a personal site. It is a GitHub Pages project, using Jekyll and more specifically [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It is licensed under CC 4.0, so have at it.  

Also, I am new at this, so if you find that my site uses something from Jekyll Now that you created, please notify me and I will remove it from my repo. Thanks.
