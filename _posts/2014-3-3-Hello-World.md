So, after spending a lot of time tweaking Jekyll and GitHub Pages to get working on Windows (hint: it sucks!), I decided to just fork an existing Jekyll installation that was Windows-friendly and was themed. I also tried my hand at manually creating HTML, which was nice, but as always, the CSS part bored me to death. I will get you one day, CSS.  
I'm trying to figure out if it's even worth it to migrate things from my excisting Drupal blog. Probably not.  
See you!
