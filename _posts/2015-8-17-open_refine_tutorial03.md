title: An OpenRefine Tutorial, Part 3
---

## A Quick Analysis of Intentions

This part of the tutorial is all about the scripting and more complex aspects of OpenRefine, but since this aspect is a potential rabbit hole, we should figure out what it is we want to 'do'. In general, I want to avoid throwing everything advanced into the scary 'programming' box because this isn't really programming, simply determining which functions of the tool to harness.    

If you want to simply continue with the data cleanup aspects, there will be some scripting-like things (specifically using [GREL](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language)) that will come in handy.  

If you want to start to reconcile your metadata in the sense of adding structure to your data via [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), or incorporating Linked Data through 'Named Entity Recognition', that will be handled as well.
