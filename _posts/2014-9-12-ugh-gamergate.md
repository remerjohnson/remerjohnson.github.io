title: Ugh, GamerGate
---

It's not surprising, but the state of video games has not improved any since we last left it in flames weeks ago. I posted then about my feelings, which were mixed. That has also not changed, but rather solidified. Which is why I say "UGH!", because it means this drama has to be prolonged, and the world outside games points at us and laughs.

Still: it's worth examining a little more, as tiresome as it is. When we last left it, #GamerGate had been started in earnest, but was quickly painted as a misogynist movement. Things are slightly different now. Many gamers have taken up the #GamerGate flag, even withstanding the revelation that at least part of it was devised by 4chan, the anonymous forum that spawns some... let's say *interesting* content. It's not surprising that elements of #GamerGate are astroturfed, but it's also not an indictment or reason to abandon it. That's the nature of social media today: someone invents a hashtag, and it takes off. People attach meaning and arguments to it, both for and against it. At least in this regard, #GamerGate is not especially corrupted by this revelation. See: #CancelColbert   

The thing about 4chan, Anonymous, Reddit, and various dark places of the Internet is: they are not good enemies to have. Because these groups are great at digging up information, either through hacking or legitimate means, they can shape discussions. And information is power, as trite as that sounds.  

So what #GamerGate has in its corner (if anything) is the power to investigate every little detail of their targets. And as humans, no matter if we're feminists, morally good, or ethically pure; we all make mistakes and tell little white lies. And that's exaclty what seems to be happening now. Even the smallest slip-up or fib could turn into 'proof' of corruption and hypocrisy.  

Still, Zoe Quinn enjoys great mainstream and video game press coverage, as does Anita Sarkeesian. Personally, after reviewing this whole mess, I am pretty ambivalent toward Zoe Quinn. I'm glad she makes games, and I want her to continue, even if I will never play them. I think everyone, absolutely everyone, who wants to make games should. I just don't like her personally, in the same vein as Phil Fish. In general, they come off as mean, hyperbolic, and entitled.  

So what, though? I could say that about literally dozens of video game developers, indie or AAA. And it sure as hell doesn't mean she should be treated like she has been. It doesn't mean anyone has the right or should feel inclined to threaten their lives. Just as when a Call of Duty developer was threatened with murder for introducing changes into a software patch, it's reprehensible and juvenile behavior. It's disgusting.    

Anita Sarkeesian, however, is doing something different. She is not a game developer; she is a much needed video game culture critic. We don't really have those in video games. Sure, we have *reviewers*, and we even have academic critcism,  but the *cultural* criticism is few and far between, usually only seen in sites like [Rock, Paper, Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/) (Sorry, [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/) is pretty bad at both game coverage *and* criticism). 

Sarkeesian's analyses are barely controversial, and part of what makes me hesitate to adopt the #GamerGate flag is that many in that movement actually find Anita's analysis unfair. I don't see the problem with having a voice exist that you don't agree with, as long as it's carried out in good faith (and notwithstanding the intolderable producer of Feminist Frequency, Jonathan McIntosh, she seems to fit). Furthermore, asking for objectivity in art or journalism is silly. Sure, there are nits to pick with Feminist Frequency videos, but this happens to be the case in, oh, just about every well-reasoned video ever made.    

And now I finish with yet again calling for both sides to not engage in such vitriol. But really, that will never be heeded. Instead of growing up in the age of Internet trolling and insults in the '90s, learning from it, and rejecting that behavior, we all seem to have instead adopted that behavior. We know words matter, we know they cause damage, and yet we think we can simultaneously take the high ground while debasing people. You can't thread that needle. 

So while #GamerGate has a lot more to account for on the harassment side, we can't really excuse people engaging in the same hate-fueled social media tirades.  

As much as I would like this whole thing to go away, it doesn't look like it will any time soon. There are some bright spots, like: 

* Video game journalism sites updating their policies. This can never be a bad thing.
* Some interesting discussions about how we would make games different. For example, there was an excellent discussion in the comments (I know, right?!) on Rock, Paper, Shotgun on how to shift the paradigm away from the "brooding dark male hero who murders everything because his family was murdered" trope by maybe having a game based on the Dungeons and Dragons' Bard class.
* A general awareness that women in tech, video games, and hell, women just trying to play or tweet about video games online face daily, despicable harassment. This is obviously bigger than games or tech, but merits mentioning.  
* An awareness that we need all kinds of help when it comes to telling good stories in video games. 
 
But it was totally not worth it. Ugh.
