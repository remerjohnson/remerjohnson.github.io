title: Toward a Metadata Pipeline
---

Now that I've been in my first librarian gig for almost 5 months (whoa), I've got a solid grasp on how things are done with regards to our digital repository and how metadata gets "made". I also of course bring baggage with me, good and bad, from library school and elsewhere. This baggage contains thoughts, theories, dreams, ambitions of where I've been and where I want the metadata to go. Where the present of "how we do this now" and the baggage collide is a perhaps idealistic notion of how the whole process should work (in my opinion, naturally). I wanted this post to frame out that process broadly, into a blueprint or pipeline. Much of the inspiration comes from a wonderful and healthy IT department, its connections to the larger open source community, and the recent DCMI Conference in Austin.   

The downside is that this pipeline really only works specifically for my institution. However, I think and hope it is broad enough to make it applicable to most small-to-midsize academic libraries. Another caveat is that this isn't a new thing I invented (it synthesizes concepts from [Free Your Metadata](freeyourmetadata.org) and [RDF Application Profiles](http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/RDF_Application_Profiles), merely it is a decent framework that I think should get more attention and could help many an institution jump into the modern non-MARC world, such as it is. The goal is cleaner metadata, while at the same time achieving efficiency. A side benefit is that this data will be Linked Data friendly and can be further enhanced any number of ways.
