title: Support the Ada Initiative
---

When I first applied for a job at UC San Diego, I was asked to complete a Diversity Statement. It was somewhat awkward to write, because I had no experience designing inclusive programs. I was greatly inspired by [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/) and [The Ada Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/), but my neck of the woods is metadata, not coding.  

I would love to do something similar, except designed for libraries and metadata. Because, despite librarianship being overwhelmingly female, it is very white, and the more technical the position, the more likely it is occupied by a man. I'd like to change that.  

In the meantime, I urge people to please donate to The Ada Initiative, and organizations like it. Good intentions only go so far! We need resources and influence to change the dynamic.  

Give what you can, and as a bonus, you get a sweet sticker.
