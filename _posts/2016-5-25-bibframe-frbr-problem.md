title: BIBFRAME Has a FRBR Problem
---

Now that [BIBFRAME 2.0](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/index.html) has slowly been rolling out, I feel like we are moving from the alpha phase to the beta phase. And in that regard, we can finally start to finally critique BIBFRAME and have it not seem unfair. And believe me, it was hard to hold back over the many, many glaring problems with BIBFRAME 1.0.  

To put my critique into context, let's look at what the [stated goals of BIBFRAME were](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/faqs/):  
1. [I]ntegrate with and engage in the wider information community and still serve the very specific needs of libraries.  
1. Differentiate clearly between conceptual content and its physical/digital manifestation(s).  
1. Leverage and expose relationships between and among entities.

Now, let me first say that I don't consider 2. to be a necessary goal.
