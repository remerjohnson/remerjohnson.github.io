title: My Favorite Games of 2014
--- 

A lot of the gaming press is lamenting 2014, calling it a slow, disappointing year. I don't agree, but maybe that's because I had gaming years during N64, SegaCD, and 3DO eras. Those were lean times, my friend.   

The PC continues to be a magical platform for gaming. While Steam is still the storefront of choice to buy digital PC games, it no longer has a virtual chokehold on the PC game market. EA's Origin is a disaster, but it is required to play any Electronic Arts PC games. More positively, [Good Old Games](http://www.gog.com/) has gained momentum this year in the PC game ecosystem, with the value-added proposition of selling every game DRM-free (Steam is in itself a DRM platform, and its games can have additional DRM schemes).  

Linux is slowly taking off for gaming, due in no small part to the [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) store. These games are also DRM-free, and often cross platform (in an OS way), as well as cross desktop/mobile platforms. Unfortunately, a disappointment for Linux gaming this year was the slowness of [SteamOS](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/) getting out of the gate, as well as the delay of Steam Machines. Whenever these do release in mature states, they have the potential to inject some seriousness into the Linux gaming space. Of course, anyone wanting to take shortcuts and do it themselves can merely buy a small motherboard and make their own machine, then throw SteamOS beta on it. Plug in some controllers and you have a great living room console that plays PC games and is also... a PC.   

The console space I can't really speak to with any authority, so you can definitely ignore the lack of XBone or PS4 exclusives in my list. I do have a Wii U, but missed a few of the major releases like Smash Brothers.  

## Mario Kart 8

Although Mario Kart made a lot of the Best Of lists this year, I was surprised to see how many claims there were of it being  repetitive and "more of the same". It's no major departure, but Mario Kart 8 introduces as many innovations and features as I can remember in the series.  

Many people lament the changing of battle courses to be basically the racing courses, but I really enjoy this change. It gave beginning players a bit of a chance to run away if they hadn't memorized the item block placement, and made a few different strategies besides "get the 3 green shell powerup and slam into people". We also can't forget this is the first Mario Kart in HD, the addition of anti-gravity, and the addition of DLC and Amiibo characters. This was the first Mario Kart I had to play since Gamecube.  

## Valkyria Chronicles

This game is only new for PC, but is the only version I have played. Nintendo's Fire Emblem series is one of my favorites, and while Valkyria Chronicles is vastly different in its game systems, it is also a Japanese strategy RPG with engaging characters you really care about. The alternate reality where steampunk elements meet World War II (roughly paralleling the invasion of Poland I think?) is a surprisingly fresh take for a WWII-based video game. I honestly haven't explored this game very deeply yet, 

## Skyrim (SkyRE)  

Yes, I know Skyrim is like 3 years old. But early this year, I installed the overhaul mod (meaning a mod so large, it changes most game systems radically) [Skyrim Redone](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9286/?tab=1&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D9286%26preview%3D&pUp=1). This in addition to a few mods for racial abilities is all you need to make a completely altered, and in my opinion, vastly superior game to the original release. The difficulty changes in the sense that the same spamming of attacks will get you quickly killed, but once you learn the skills introduced like timed blocking and relying on spells, the game becomes immensely enjoyable. I'm already planning another playthrough with the Skyrim DLC in 2015.
