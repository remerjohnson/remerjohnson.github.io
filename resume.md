## Background

Ryan E. Johnson is a Metadata and Data Curation Specialist with UC San Diego's Geisel Library. He works on the metadata for digital collection in the [UC San Diego Digital Collections](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/), also known as DAMS (Digital Asset Management System). Besides working with Special Collections and the Digital Library Programs, he is a member of the Research Data Curation Program, where he provides expertise in metadata and solicits information from researchers about their data.  

Originally from Los Angeles, Ryan received his Master's from Syracuse University in Library and Information Science, with a specialization in Digital Libraries. While currently preoccupied with the world of metadata, he is interested in data cleaning and transformation, addressing the challenges of Linked Data, and collaborating with library information technology professionals to build software that provides users with excellent information.  

## Experience

+ Metadata and Data Curation Specialist, UC San Diego  
_2014 - current_  

As a member of the Digital Object Metadata Management Unit, I clean, map, and transform metadata from data providers to align with the data model of our DAMS (Digital Asset Management System). I am the Metadata Analyst on about a dozen digital collections, ranging from Special Collections papers to protein sequencing analysis. I helped to refine and plan new data models for the DAMS that better take advantage of Linked Data, best practices, and decisions that the larger metadata community have agreed upon. I also contributed to the stramlining of the process of getting digital collections published, which went from the average of many months (sometimes a year) to weeks, through planning and collaborating with IT to develop ingest tools.  

For context, the UC San Diego DAMS is composed of a triplestore backend (currently undergoing a transition to Fedora), Hydra, Blacklight and Solr. The metadata I most commonly work with is RDF/XML.
