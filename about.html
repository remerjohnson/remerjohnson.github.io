<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
Hi! My name is <span itemprop="name">Ryan E. Johnson</span>. You are at my new homepage, <a href="http://remerjohnson.github.io/" itemprop="url">http://remerjohnson.github.io/</a>. I am a <span itemprop="title">Metadata Librarian</span> at <span itemprop="affiliation">UC San Diego</span>. I make sure digital objects in repositories are described and marked up correctly so that they are discoverable in many ways, including utilizing Linked Data. I also help researchers in Research Data Curation to describe their research. I can be reached at <span itemprop="email">ryan.emerson.johnson@gmail.com</span>. 
</div>  
<p>You can view all this pretty metadata in the <a href="http://library.ucsd.edu/dc">UC San Diego Digital Collections</a>.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>I typically blog about metadata and libraries, but I often also write about tech, maker culture, and video games. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
