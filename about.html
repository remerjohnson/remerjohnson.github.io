<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
My name is <span itemprop="name">Ryan Johnson</span>.I am a <span itemprop="JobTitle">Metadata Librarian</span> at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu/). I make sure digital objects in repositories are described and marked up correctly so that they are discoverable in many ways, including utilizing Linked Data. I also help researchers in Research Data Curation to describe their research.

You can view all this pretty metadata in the [UC San Diego Digital Collections](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc).
